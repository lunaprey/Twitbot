TwitBot

TwitBot is a simple tool which waits until you are on the twitter home page, and then checks to see if it can grab your data. If it can, it assumes you are logged in, and allows you, the user, to begin making use of it's tools.

The main tools of TwitBot are it's ability to follow hundreds of people at a time. Users may select a target user. The bot will then proceed to follow all followers of that target user. In this way, you may choose the interests of your followers.

Additionally, the unfollower tool simply navigates to your follower page, and unfollowes every single user who is not following you.

To make use of TwitBot, simply open Google Chrome, navigate to the selection panel on the top right, and choose "More Tools", then select "Extensions".

Once on the Extensions page, select "Load Unpacked Extensions...". It is a button found on the top left of the screen. Select the TwitBot folder, and press ok. Your TwitBot should now be ready. You should now see a white Twitter bird in the top right hand corner of your Chrome browser. Clicking on it will get you the rest of the way. Good luck, adventurerer!
